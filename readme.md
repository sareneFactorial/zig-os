# Test Zig Kernel

Code is currently uploaded in a bit of a messy, WIP state- I haven't worked on this much recently. Uploaded mainly to showcase what I've done.

This kernel is in the middle of being updated to a multitasking, memory managing kernel, so it might not function as-is without all the parts complete, but the individual parts should all function.

This project was done by me intermittently throughout my last few years of high school and first few years of college, probably around 2019-2022. Self-learned OS design and Zig.
